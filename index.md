This is a  hands on tutorial of the XML and JSON data formats, and how they are found/used/experienced in the Gallaries/Libraries/Archives/Museum (GLAM) sector.

Typically tutorials for both XML and JSON are centered around the use of these data types in relation to HTML and webpages.

In GLAM we often encounter XML, and increasingly JSON as a data container format that is not directly related to HTML or web pages.

This session is an opportunity to explore the data formats in a GLAM context, and how they relate to content and information we use in our work.

For both XML and JSON we'll look at 

Basic structure of / tour of format
.How to open these files
.How to read/validate these files
.Basic rules (nesting, order, reserved chars etc)
.Adding elements
.Extending to new data

We will not be covering 
. via DTD / XLT / schema
.Computational Access to data in these formats
